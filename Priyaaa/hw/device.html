    <p>A computer is a <span style="color: blue;"> machine</span> that can be programmed to automatically carry out
        sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of
        operaions known as <span style="color: blue;">programs</span>.These programs enable computers to perform a wide
        range of tasks.The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the <span
            style="color: blue;"> hardware,operating system,software</span> and pheripheral equipment
        needed and used for full operation or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
        computer network or computer cluster.A broad range of industrrial and consumer products use computers as control
        systems, including simple specific-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices
        like industrial robots.Computers are at the core of general-purpose devices such as <span style="color: blue;">
            personal computers</span> and <span style="color: blue;"> mobile devices</span> such as
        smartphones.Computers power the internet,which links billions of computers and users.Early computers were ment
        to be used only for calculations.A modern compuer consist of at last one processing element,typically a <abbr
            title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of
        computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips.Computers have been used to coordinate information between
        multiple locations since the 1950s.Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable
        function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed.
        A computer is a device that accepts information and manipulates it for some result based on a program, software
        or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed.A computer is a machine that can store and
        process information.

    <h2 id="printer">Printer</h2>
    <p>A printer is a pheripheral machine which makes a durable representation of graphics or text, usually on
        paper.While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for
        printers.Different types of printers imclude 3D printers,laser printers, and thermal printers.The choice of
        print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and
        permanence of documents, and noise. Some printer technologies do not work with certain types of physical media,
        such a carbon paper or transparencies.
        Printers can be connected in many ways: directly by a dedicated data cable such as the USB, through a short
        range radio like Bluetooth, a local area network using cables(such as the Ethernet) or radio or on a standalone
        basis without a computer,using a memory card or other portable data storage device.Today, most printers accept
        one or more <abbr title="Page Description Languages"> PLDs</abbr>.Printer,<ins> electronic</ins> device that
        accepts text files or images from a computer and transfers them to a medium such as paper or flim.
        It can be connected directly to the computer or indirectly via a network.Printers are classified as impact
        printers(in which the print medium is physically struck) and non-impact printers.Most impact printers are
        dot-matrix printers, which have a number of pins on the print head that emerge to form a character.Non-impact
        printers fall into three categories:<ins> laser</ins> printers use a laser beam to attract toner to an area of
        the paper;<ins> ink-jet</ins> printers spray a jet of liquid ink; and <ins> thermal</ins> printers transfer
        wax-based ink or use heated pins to directlyimprint an
        image on specially treated paper.Important printer characteristics include resolution(in dots per inch),
        speed(in sheets of paperr printed per minute), colour(full-color or black and white), and <ins><span
                style="color: blue;"> cache memory</span></ins>(which affects the speed at which a file can be printed.)
