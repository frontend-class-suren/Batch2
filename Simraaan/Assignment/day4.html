        <hr>
        <p>In this reported op-ed, Chicago-based writer, organizer, and artist Eva Maria Lewis speaks with friends and
            family of Breonna Taylor for her birthday, June 5, reflecting on the legacy Taylor leaves behind.</p>
        <h4>By Eva Lewis <br> <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: lighter;">
                June 5, 2020</span></h4>
        <p>Breonna Taylor would be 27 today. She was 26 years old when she was shot to death by police after a day of
            serving her community as a first responder. Although her name has become known after her death, her life
            paints a legacy of light, love, and unparalleled kindness. Among others, she leaves behind her mother Tamika
            Palmer, her sister Ju’Niyah Palmer, her cousin Preonia Flakes, her older-sister-cousin Katrina Curry, and
            her best friends Alena Battle and Erinicka Hunter, all six of whom told Teen Vogue about the ways Breonna
            changed their lives for the better by living the “Bree way.”

            When Breonna was a child, her mother knew she was destined for greatness. Tamika recalls that after Breonna
            witnessed her take her diabetic grandmother’s blood sugar, Breonna was eager to do it too, foreshadowing
            Breonna’s future in the medical field. Reminiscing, Tamika says, “It was the cutest thing.”

            Throughout her life, those who knew her say Breonna expressed her love for others through empowerment and
            support. When she was in high school, her teacher called her mother because Breonna would not go to the
            pizza party in another classroom for students doing exceptionally well because her friends were not invited.
            When her mother received the call, she tells Teen Vogue that she said, “If your friends don’t want to see
            you do great, they’re not your friends.” To which Breonna replied, “I’m going to help my friends be great.”
            Later in life, her motto would become, “All you can do every day is wake, pray, and slay.”

            It never sat right with Breonna to elevate herself without bringing people up with her. Her best friend
            Alena says Breonna was like her “walking diary” that she could open up to. No matter the distance, Alena and
            Breonna would always find time and space for each other.

            “I was able to share everything with her with no judgement. Breonna was my person, she was like a big sister
            to me,” Alena says. “Breonna taught me about finance, careers, business, and creating generational wealth.
            She taught me how to be a friend, and about relationships. If you ever needed someone to boost your
            confidence, that was Bree.” Ju’Niyah describes being Breonna’s younger sister as “the best thing ever”; if
            Ju’Niyah ever needed help, Breonna was there. Whether it was making sure Ju’Niyah looked and felt bomb for
            prom, rescuing her from parties, or driving over an hour on the highway to help her with a flat tire,
            Breonna never missed a beat.

            Never missing a beat characterized Breonna’s life when it came to friends and family. Her cousin Katrina
            describes Breonna as the “show up and never disappoint” cousin, like when Breonna saved her 29th birthday
            party.

            “We had a birthday dinner for me at Olive Garden, and there were five of us sitting at the end of a table
            for 16 people. I said, ‘I don’t think people are going to come,’” she shares. “Breonna said the vibe was
            awkward, and asked all of us to go to the middle of the table. After that, we ended up having a good time.”

            “With Breonna, it didn’t matter how many people showed up, you were going to have a good time,” Katrina
            continues. “All of the negativity was out the window. It was so special, and I realize that now more than
            ever. It was beautiful how she could cheer people up. By the end of that night, you couldn’t tell any of us
            there were only five people at that table. Breonna taught me how to enjoy life.”

            Another best friend of Breonna, Erinicka, says along with the nicknames Bre, Bosslady Breezy, and Nonna,
            Erinicka called her friend a “ride or die” because “that’s what she was.” She regards Breonna as the “best
            friend she’s ever had,” adding a firm and sincere “period.” She says Breonna was a “sweet, beautiful, and
            caring soul that just wanted me to be great. She wanted greatness for everyone she came across.”

            Those who know her say Breonna was intentional about bringing joy everywhere she went. While chuckling, her
            family and friends describe her as “goofy.”

            “Breonna always smiled,” her mother tells Teen Vogue. “I can remember being mad at her and she would be
            smiling. She would say, ‘Sis, you ain’t got to be that mad, it ain’t that serious.’ Which would piss me off
            and make me laugh. I swear I’ll miss that.” </p>

        <hr>
        <p>Let me be clear: stating that black lives matter doesn’t insinuate that other lives don’t. </p>
        <h4>By Rachel Cargle <br> <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: lighter;">
                Apr 17, 2019</span></h4>
        <p> Black lives did not matter when they were inhumanely transported like livestock from Africa. Black lives did
            not matter when they were lynched by the hundreds at the hands of the KKK. Black lives did not matter when
            they were attacked by dogs as they protested for equal rights.

            With the weekly news cycle seeming to, without fail, include the death of at least one black boy at the
            hands of the police, or the body of a black woman being thrown to the ground by local law enforcement, or a
            black child being manhandled by the services meant to protect them, my heart sinks as I cling to the desire
            that black lives will matter.
            When Nancy Pelosi, as part of MSNBC’s town hall last year, was asked by student Shelly Ward if she supported
            the Black Lives Matter movement, Pelosi’s response was an all too familiar “Well, I believe that all lives
            matter”. Her statement was to the very obvious disappointment of the young black woman who asked the
            question, and to the disappointment of an exhausted black community.As someone who is constantly bombarded
            with the howling of “but all lives matter”—and the heated conversations that inevitably follow—let me
            explain. Black Lives Matter is not a term of confrontation or an exclusionary demand. As Columbia Law
            Professor Kimberle Crenshaw explains, saying black lives matter “is simply aspirational;” it's a rallying
            cry for a shift in statistical numbers that show that people who are black are twice as likely to be killed
            by a police officer while unarmed, compared to a white individual. According to a 2015 study,
            African-Americans died at the hands of police at a rate of 7.2 per million, while whites were killed at a
            rate of 2.9 per million.

            Anyone who has kept any type of pulse on civil rights and the black human condition in the United States
            since the transatlantic slave trade would understand the need to emphasize the protection of black bodies.
            The people who have had the luxury of ignoring this particular issue is the white community, which has had
            the privilege of not questioning—on a large scale—whether the systems they live in are detrimental to their
            livelihoods, based on their skin color.

            But as the Black Lives Matter movement emerged, they were all of a sudden jolted into an awareness of the
            intersection of race and surviving police encounters. Instead of exploring the reasons why a movement like
            this would even be necessary, many have a knee jerk reaction. “What about me?” “All lives matter,” they cry.
            “Why be divisive and unfair, what about our safety?” The point these people miss is that the majority of
            experiences here in America already tend to center and highlight whiteness and cater to its safety. The
            country was built to function that way. Its roots of white supremacy and the marginalized concern for people
            of color has remained.

            Today, looking at the gross brutality and murders of black American citizens like Oscar Grant, Michelle
            Cusseaux, Samuel Dubose, and Jordan Edwards, we are still aspiring to convince you that black lives matter.
            But let's get back to the issue of countering Black Lives Matter with the phrase “All Lives Matter.” I've
            come to describe this as a collective gaslighting from the white community. Gaslighting is a tactic in which
            a person or entity, in order to gain more power (or in this case, keep their own peace), makes a victim
            question their reality. Why do those who counter black lives matter act as though black people aren't aware
            of the glaring disproportionate statistics of police brutality, of health care racism, and of mass
            incarceration? This is our reality. You deciding to ignore it for your own comfort doesn't make it any less
            true.

            If a patient being rushed to the ER after an accident were to point to their mangled leg and say, “This is
            what matters right now,” and the doctor saw the scrapes and bruises of other areas and countered, “but all
            of you matters,” wouldn’t there be a question as to why he doesn't show urgency in aiding that what is most
            at risk? At a community fundraiser for a decaying local library, you would never see a mob of people from
            the next city over show up angry and offended yelling, “All libraries matter!”—especially when theirs is
            already well-funded.

            This is because there is a fundamental understanding that when the parts of society with the most pain and
            lack of protection are cared for, the whole system benefits. For some reason, the community of white America
            would rather adjust the blinders they’ve set against racism, instead of confront it, so that the country can
            move forward toward a true nation of justice for all.</p>

        <p>A headline-grabbing murder-for-hire plot helped expose the dark side of exotic animal ownership in the U.S.
            Is there now enough momentum to reform the industry? </p>
        <h4>By Rachel Nuwer <br> <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: lighter;">
                March 16, 2020</span></h4>
        <p>It’s a gloomy April afternoon in rural Oklahoma, and I’m sitting on the floor of a fluorescent-lit room at a
            roadside zoo with Nova, a 12-week-old tiliger. She looks like a tiger cub, but she’s actually a crossbreed,
            an unnatural combination of a tiger father and a mother born of a tiger and a lion. That unique genetic
            makeup places a higher price tag on cubs like Nova, and makes it easier, legally speaking, to abuse and
            exploit them. Endangered species protections don’t apply to artificial breeds such as tiligers.
            Hybridization, however, has done nothing to quell Nova’s predatory instincts. For the umpteenth time during
            the past six minutes, she lunges at my face, claws splayed and mouth ajar — only to be halted mid-leap as
            her handler jerks her harness. Unphased, Nova gets right back to pouncing.

            With her dusty blue eyes, sherbet-colored paws, and prominent black stripes, Nova is adorable. But she also
            weighs 30 pounds and has teeth like a Doberman’s and claws the size of jumbo shrimp. Nova’s handler, a woman
            with long brown hair who tells me she recently retired from her IT job at a South Dakota bank to live out
            her dream of working with exotic cats, scolds the rambunctious tiliger in a goo-goo-ga-ga voice: “Nooooo,
            nooooo, you calms down!” Nova is teething, the handler explains, so she just wants something to chew on. The
            handler reaches for one of the tatty stuffed animals strewn around the room — a substitute, I guess, for my
            limbs. In that moment of distraction, Nova lunges. She lands her mark, chomping into the bicep of my
            producer, Graham Lee Brewer.

            “Ooo, she got me!” Lee Brewer grimaces as he attempts to pull away from the determined predator. Nova’s
            handler has to pry the tiliger’s jaws open to detach her. After the incident, the woman conveniently checks
            her watch: “OK, you guys, time is up!”

            I paid $80 for the pleasure of spending 12 minutes with Nova, but I’m glad the experience, billed as a
            once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, is over. On our way out, we pass more than a dozen adult tigers yowling and
            pacing cages the size of small classrooms. Nearby signs solicit donations. You are their only hope. Sponsor
            a cabin or compound today! In the safety of our car, Lee Brewer rolls up his sleeve, exposing a swollen red
            welt. “Look at my gnarly tiger bite,” he chuckles. “I tried to play it off but I was like, this fuckin’
            hurts!”

            It’s not the first time I’ve seen this world up-close; I spent the better part of eight years investigating
            wildlife trafficking around the world. During my travels, I visited farms in China and Laos where tigers are
            raised like pigs, examined traditional medicine in Vietnam, ate what I was told was tiger bone “cake,” and
            tracked some of the world’s last remaining wild tigers in India. Almost everywhere I went, tigers were
            suffering and their numbers were on the decline because of human behavior. Until recently, though, I had no
            idea the United States was part of the problem.

            Within a few weeks of my visit, Nova will be far too big and dangerous for overpriced playtime sessions.
            Cats like her are most likely confined to one of those cramped cages my producer and I passed leaving the
            zoo, where they spend the rest of their life being speed-bred to crank out more adorable cubs. Or Nova might
            be sold to another breeder, or to someone who wants to keep her as a pet. Although no one tracks big cat
            ownership in the U.S., it’s estimated that there are likely more pet tigers in America than there are left
            in the wild. What’s more, depending on the species of cat, federal oversight is either limited or
            nonexistent. In some states, it’s easier to buy a lion — a 400-pound predatory killer — than it is to get a
            dog.

            Animal rights activists have been pushing for decades to curb big cat ownership in this country, arguing
            that the industry is cruel, dangerous, and detrimental to conservation of cats in the wild. Now, reform
            appears within reach. The movement owes its momentum to, of all things, a murder-for-hire plot gone terribly
            awry. You might have seen the headlines in the Washington Post and New York magazine: Joe Exotic, a
            self-described “gay, gun-carrying redneck with a mullet,” among the largest tiger owners and breeders in the
            U.S., charged with conspiring to commit murder for hire. At its height, Joe’s zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma,
            which is where I visited Nova, housed more than 200 big cats, including lion-tiger hybrids, as well as about
            60 other species, everything from lemurs to owls to giraffes. Joe even acquired a pair of alligators he
            claimed were once owned by Michael Jackson. Still, as one local told me, “The animals weren’t the
            entertainment. Joe was the entertainment.”

            Last year, an Oklahoma City jury convicted Joe, whose legal name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, of the
            murder-for-hire plots against a Florida activist and sanctuary owner named Carole Baskin. For Joe, Baskin
            had become something of an arch tiger rival. The news coverage mostly focused on Joe’s outlandish
            personality and the details of his decade-long feud with Baskin. But the jury also found Joe guilty of 17
            wildlife crimes, including illegally killing five tigers and trafficking tigers across state lines — marking
            the first significant conviction of a tiger criminal in an American courtroom. “This verdict sends a shot
            across the bow to other roadside zoos who are playing fast and loose with federal regulations,” said Carney
            Anne Nasser, director of the animal welfare clinic at Michigan State University College of Law.

            In other words, the bad boy of the big cat world might have inadvertently contributed to cleaning up the
            dirty industry he helped build and then exploited for much of his adult life. <br>* * *<br>Big cats are
            easier to
            find than you might think. I recently struck up a conversation with the chef at my favorite sushi joint in
            New York City. He asked what I’d been working on, and I filled him in on a bit of the Joe Exotic story and
            the big cat trade. To my surprise, he nodded along knowingly: “Oh yeah, a buddy of mine just got a serval!”
            Celebrity culture is another hot spot for exotic animal ownership. This past fall, Justin Bieber reportedly
            spent $35,000 on two savannah cats and created a dedicated Instagram page that quickly amassed more than
            500,000 followers. When PETA criticized Bieber’s new pet choice, he posted a statement on his Instagram
            story telling the nonprofit group to “suck it” and “focus on real problems.”

            Shopping for an unconventional animal used to mean scanning the classified sections of newspapers or fliers
            on the cluttered billboards at grocery stores and gas stations. But those analog methods of sale have long
            since given way to people hawking large cats in ways that are now more traditionally modern: closed Facebook
            groups and exotic pet websites. Getting an ocelot or a cheetah can be as easy as sending a DM or text,
            agreeing on a price, and setting a pick-up date. Depending on what state you live in, owning one of these
            animals might be entirely legal. And even if it’s not, there’s almost always a way to sidestep the rules,
            which can be confusing and are rarely enforced.

            Save for a handful of regulations pertaining to animals listed in the Endangered Species Act (ESA), there’s
            almost no oversight of big cat ownership by the federal government. The Animal Welfare Act is supposed to
            ensure humane treatment of big cats and other captive animals, but the inspectors are overworked and many of
            the rules are weak, vague, or both. Although the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) does technically require a
            permit to sell endangered species such as tigers, lions, leopards, or jaguars across state lines,
            unscrupulous sellers and buyers often don’t want to bother with permits and deal in untraceable cash
            payments. At trial, one buyer even testified to participating in sales marked as “donations.” Joe Exotic
            used this tactic for years to evade the gaze of law enforcement. He wasn’t the only one. At Joe’s trial,
            that same tiger owner testified: “Everybody marks donation.” </p>

        <hr>

        <p>In this, the age of the global pantry, ingredients like turmeric, tahini, and gochujang have finally shaken
            off their hitherto “exotic” status. But it’s white cooking personalities like Alison Roman and many of the
            Bon Appétit Test Kitchen stars who have had viral success using them.</p>
        <h4>By Navneet Alang <br> <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: lighter;">
                May 20, 2020</span></h4>
        <p>AisonAlison Roman is the “prom queen of the pandemic.” Or, at least, she was. The cookbook author and YouTube
            star, who rose to fame on the strength of her heady-yet-approachable recipes, low-key glamour, and
            self-effacing charm, recently experienced what she referred to as “baby’s first internet backlash.” It
            stemmed from a recent interview that Roman gave in which she criticized both minimalism icon Marie Kondo and
            cookbook author Chrissy Teigen for peddling branded merchandise, implying that they were sellouts — while
            discussing her own “capsule collection” of cooking tools, no less. A low hum of outrage greeted Roman’s
            choice to rebuke two women of color, then positively exploded after Teigen created a long thread on Twitter
            to talk about how hurt she was, as someone who “genuinely loved everything about Alison.”

            The backlash to Roman’s comments, like most backlashes, was a combination of legitimate grievance and the
            way that Twitter refracts and concentrates reaction. All the same, there was a whiff of inevitability to the
            suddenness and vociferousness of the anger directed at Roman, who had become ubiquitous thanks in part to
            her knack for proselytizing ostensibly “ethnic” ingredients like tahini, turmeric, and yuzu kosho to a
            broader American audience. Roman’s critics charged that she was not only a hypocrite but a racist, one who
            had moreover very successfully capitalized on the ingredients of other cultures. If it felt as though people
            had been sitting around waiting for her to mess up, it was probably because many of them had.

            Roman, after all, is arguably the most fashionable avatar of a broader shift. We are living in the age of
            the global pantry, when a succession of food media-approved, often white figures have made an array of
            international ingredients approachable and even desirable to the North American mainstream — the same
            mainstream that, a decade ago, would have labeled these foods as obscure at best and off-putting at worst.
            This phenomenon is why you now see dukkah on avocado toast, kimchi in grain bowls, and sambal served with
            fried Brussels sprouts. It’s a kind of polyglot internationalism presented under the New American umbrella,
            with the techniques and raw materials of non-Western cuisines used to wake up the staid, predictable flavors
            of familiar Americana.

            Not long ago, you could see this playing out on the menus of hip restaurants across the country. At AL’s
            Place in San Francisco, squash tahini was served with burrata, sumac-galangal dressing, pickles, and dukkah;
            in LA, there was preserved Meyer lemon and lacto-fermented hot sauce in Sqirl’s sorrel pesto rice bowl, and
            a “Turkish-ish” breakfast of vegetables, a sumac- and Aleppo pepper-dusted egg, and three-day-fermented
            labneh at Kismet. Over in Nashville, Cafe Roze put a turmeric egg in its hard-boiled BLT and miso ranch in
            its barley salad. Up in New York, Dimes served a veggie burger with harissa tofu and a dish called huevos
            Kathmandu that paired green chutney and spiced chickpeas with fried eggs.
        <h3>Only whiteness can deracinate and subsume <br> the world of culinary influences into itself and yet <br>
            remain
            unnamed</h3> But now, as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced most of us to stay home and make the most of our
        kitchen skills, the global pantry is most visible on the pages and websites of establishment food media. It’s
        Bon Appétit’s gluten-free coconut-turmeric pie and kimchi-cream cheese toast; Food & Wine’s tofu masala and rosy
        harissa chicken; the New York Times’s brothy chicken soup with hominy and poblano; and Every Day With Rachael
        Ray’s minty matcha smoothie and Korean barbecue burgers. You can see it all over social media and particularly
        Instagram, where its most viral example is #thestew, Roman’s 2018 recipe for a chickpea-coconut milk stew whose
        broth is made golden with turmeric. And you can see it on Bon Appétit’s extremely popular YouTube channel, where
        its test kitchen stars make everything from saffron brittle to “dahi toast” to slow-roast gochujang chicken to
        spicy chicken katsu sandwiches (though it bears noting that the first two of those recipes were created by
        people of color).

        As the culinary has become a marker of contemporary culture, occupying much of the space once monopolized by
        music or fashion, food media and social media have fused to create a supercharged form of aspirational desire.
        Within this mode of desire, however, the idea of using new, hitherto “exotic” ingredients only seems to become
        aspirational when those ingredients appear on the pages of prominent tastemaking magazines (or, perhaps more
        relevantly, on Instagram) — or are espoused by white tastemakers. Remember that time in 2018 when the author
        Stephanie Danler told T Magazine about her “kitchari cleanse,” explaining how the Indian dish of lentils and
        rice (actually called khichrhi) allowed her to “reset [her] system”? Or the time that haldi doodh took over
        coffee shop menus, the food media, and Instagram after being rebranded as the turmeric latte?

        The question that such representations present for the food world is a difficult one: Who gets to use the global
        pantry or introduce “new” international ingredients to a Western audience? And behind that is an even more
        uncomfortable query: Can the aspiration that has become central to the culinary arts ever not be white?

        Because the aesthetics of food media are indeed white. That white aesthetic is not, strictly speaking, the
        abundant natural light, ceramic plates, strategically scattered handfuls of fresh herbs, pastel dining rooms,
        artisan knives, or even the butcher diagram tattoos that the food media so loves to fetishize. It is more
        accurate to say that the way we define what is contemporary and fashionable in food is tied to whiteness as a
        cultural norm — and to its ability to incorporate other cultures without actually becoming them. </p>

        <h2 id="5">5. Black Communities Have Always Used Food as Protest</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>For 500 years, Black communities in America have sustained and supported protest through food.</p>
        <h4>By Amethyst Ganaway <br> <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: lighter;">
                June 04, 2020</span></h4>
        <p>Black people in America have used food as a means of resistance, rebellion, and revolution since being
            forcefully brought here in the late 1500s. Food has always been a part of the culture and identity of Black
            communities and has played a role as a source of both comfort and strength for a people constantly subject
            to abuse, discrimination, and misunderstanding. In African-derived religions, worshippers leave food
            offerings to orishas, the minor gods and goddesses in the pantheon of West African beliefs. Believers left
            Ogun, God of the Forge and War, offerings of nuts, berries, meat, and roots from his believers before they
            went into war. Yemaya, ruler of oceans and the embodiment of Black femininity and power, has her own
            favorite foods: watermelon, molasses, and maize, as well as fish, poultry, and nuts that she prefers in
            thanks of her blessings. So even when those same foods revered by the gods and goddesses of their ancestral
            homelands were turned into means of stereotyping and racial profiling, Black people were able to maintain a
            closeness with one another through the meals they ate. When the Transatlantic Slave Trade began, enslaved
            Africans would braid seeds and rice into their hair. This wasn't just a reminder of home; it was a tangible
            act of rebellion and resistance and a necessary means of survival in a world unknown to them. Brought to the
            Americas' coastal and subtropical lands for their abilities to grow specific crops like rice, people like
            the Gullah Geechee were able to survive in lands not their own, and were able to maintain a throughline to
            their traditions by growing plants and eating similar dishes that they had always known; a practice still
            carried on by communities in the Lowcountry today.

            As soon as the subjugated people could, they openly rebelled with their captors, through revolts, countering
            slavemaster violence, and acts of covert insurrection, often centered around food. By taking provisions from
            their "masters" and raiding the white plantation owners' personal larders, they sustained their livelihoods
            and actively acted against their abductors. Often outwitting the subjugating white owners and overseers by
            claiming that if they were the property of these people, and they grew the food for them, it was just as
            much theirs as his, equating it to "taking the meat out of one tub and placing it another." The same
            cooks—often women—who were revered for their culinary abilities in historical cookbooks and whose recipes
            are resurfacing today were spitting in and poisoning the food of their kidnappers and their children, and
            killing them. The pain and deaths the jailer masters faced from the poisoning and theft of food paled in
            comparison to the atrocities and horrors they inflicted on the forcibly imprisoned. Not all acts of
            rebellion based around food were necessarily violent. Farming as resistance isn't a new concept, although
            there has been a resurgence of farming in communities that have been hit especially hard by gentrification
            and food apartheid. These communities, largely Black people and other people of color, are often in places
            that don't have any source of fresh food for miles. Throughout and after slavery was abolished in the
            Americas, Black people farmed and gardened to find sustenance literally and figuratively in trying times.
            During enslavement, people would often have their own gardens to make up for the food the enslavers didn't
            or wouldn't provide. Growing the foods of their homeland like okra, peanuts, benne, watermelon, and more,
            not only were they able to eat and be connected to their culture (an act of rebellion in itself), they
            arguably made one of the most significant impacts on what is known as American cuisine. The debt that is
            owed by America to Black people is so much greater than the forty acres of land that was promised, but never
            received, and that has accrued interest for over 400 years. </p>
