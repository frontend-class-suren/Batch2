  <h2 id="Keyboard">1.Keyboard</h2>
  <p>A keyboard is an essential input device used for typing and interacting with computers and other electronics. It
    consists of a set of keys arranged in a layout that can vary depending on the keyboard type and regional
    preferences.</p><p>
    <strong>Mechanical keyboards</strong> are known for their individual switches under each key, offering a satisfying tactile feedback
    and durability. They are often favored by typists and gamers for their responsiveness and longevity. In contrast,
    membrane keyboards use a softer, quieter mechanism with a flexible membrane underneath the keys, making them
    generally more affordable but less tactile.</p><p>
    <strong>Chiclet keyboards</strong>, with their flat, separated keys, provide a modern, low-profile look and are commonly found in
    laptops. Ergonomic keyboards are designed to reduce strain and improve typing posture, featuring split layouts or
    curved designs to accommodate users who spend long hours typing.</p>

  <h2 id="Mouse">2.Mouse</h2>
  <p>
    A mouse is an essential input device used to interact with a computer or other digital systems. It typically
    features two primary buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel. The mouse moves a pointer on the screen, allowing
    users to click, drag, and navigate through various interfaces.</p><p>
    There are two main types of mice:</p>
<p><strong>* Wired Mice:</strong> Connect to the computer via a cable, offering reliable performance without the need for batteries.</p>
    <p><strong>* Wireless Mice:</strong> Connect through Bluetooth or radio frequency (RF), providing greater freedom of movement but
    requiring battery or recharging.</p>
  Some advanced mice come with additional buttons for customizable functions, ergonomic designs for comfort during
    extended use, and high-precision sensors for accurate tracking. Gaming mice, in particular, often feature adjustable
    DPI settings and programmable buttons for enhanced performance in games.<br><br>

  <h2 id="Scanner">3.Scanner</h2>
  <p>
    A scanner is an electronic device used to convert physical documents, photos, or objects into digital images. It
    captures the content of the original item and creates a digital file that can be viewed, edited, or shared on a
    computer.</p><p>
    Scanners typically come in two main types:<br>
    <strong>* Flatbed Scanners:</strong>These have a flat glass surface where you place the document or photo. The scanner's lid closes
    over the item, and an internal light source and sensor move across the document to capture the image. Flatbed
    scanners are versatile and can handle various sizes and types of documents.<br><br>
   <strong>* Sheet-fed Scanners:</strong> These are designed to handle multiple pages at once by feeding them through a document feeder.
    They are efficient for scanning large volumes of documents quickly.
    Some scanners also offer additional features, such as automatic document feeders (ADFs) for batch scanning, built-in
    optical character recognition (OCR) to convert scanned text into editable formats, and network connectivity for easy
    sharing and access.<br><br>Types of Scanners:</p><p>
   <strong>* Flatbed Scanners:</strong><br>
    -Design: Feature a flat glass surface where the item to be scanned is placed. The scanner’s lid covers the document
    to prevent light interference.<br>
    -How It Works: A moving light source (usually a lamp) and sensor system move beneath the glass to capture the image.
    The light reflects off the document and is converted into digital signals by the sensor.<br>
    -Advantages: Versatile and can handle a range of document sizes and types, including books and fragile items. Ideal
    for high-quality photo scanning.<br>
    -Limitations: Can be slower than other types, especially for large volumes of documents.<br><br>

   * Sheet-fed Scanners:<br>
   -Design: These scanners have a paper feed mechanism that pulls documents through a scanning area. They are typically
    compact and can handle multiple pages.<br>
    -How It Works: Documents are automatically fed through the scanner, and a scanning mechanism captures each page’s
    image.<br>
    -Advantages: Efficient for scanning large volumes of documents quickly. Often comes with automatic document feeders
    (ADFs) for batch scanning.<br>
    -Limitations: Less suitable for scanning bound books or delicate materials. Paper jams can occur if the feed
    mechanism is not properly maintained.<br><br>

   * Portable Scanners:<br>
    -Design: Compact and lightweight, designed for mobility. They can be handheld or use a built-in feed mechanism.<br>
    -How It Works: Portable scanners can vary in design but generally use either a roll mechanism or a small scanning
    head to capture images on-the-go.<br>
    -Advantages: Ideal for scanning documents in various locations, convenient for travel or mobile work.<br>
   -Limitations: Usually have a smaller scanning area and may offer lower resolution compared to flatbed scanners.<br><br>

   * Drum Scanners:<br>
    -Design: High-end scanners used primarily in professional settings, such as for high-resolution image reproduction.<br>
    How It Works: Documents are mounted on a rotating drum, and light sensors capture detailed images as the drum spins.<br>
    -Advantages: Provides extremely high resolution and color accuracy, suitable for professional photo and art scanning.<br>
    -Limitations: Expensive and typically used only in specialized industries.<br><br>

  <h2 id="Monitor">4.Monitor</h2>
  <p>
    A monitor is an essential output device that displays visual information from a computer or other electronic
    devices. It serves as the primary interface through which users interact with their computers, viewing everything
    from text and graphics to video and animations.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="CPU">5.CPU</h2>
  <p>
    The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It is a critical component that
    performs most of the processing tasks within a computer system. Here is a detailed overview:<br>
    Function and Role:<br>

    * Core Functions: The CPU executes instructions from programs and processes data. It performs arithmetic and logical
    operations, controls data flow between the computer hardware and software, and coordinates activities among
    different components.
    <br>
    * Instruction Execution: The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them to understand what action is
    required,
    and then executes these instructions to perform tasks.

  <h2 id="K_details">More about keyboard</h2>
  <p>
    Flexible keyboards, made from materials like silicone, can be rolled or folded for portability and durability in
    various environments. Keyboards also come with different layouts like QWERTY, the standard arrangement used in
    English-speaking countries; Dvorak and Colemak, which aim to improve typing efficiency; and AZERTY, used mainly in
    France and Belgium.<br>

    Additional features like backlighting and programmable keys can enhance usability and customization. The choice of
    keyboard often depends on personal preferences, intended use, and budget.

  <h2 id="M_details">More about Mouse</h2>
  <p>
    The basic design of a mouse includes a few key elements: it typically features two primary buttons—left and
    right—and
    a scroll wheel positioned between them. The left button is used for primary actions like selecting items or
    executing commands, while the right button usually opens context menus. The scroll wheel allows users to navigate
    through documents or web pages with ease.<br>

    Internally, a mouse relies on a sensor to detect movement. Traditional mice used a ball that rolled on a surface to
    detect movement, but modern mice use optical or laser sensors. Optical mice use an LED light to track movement by
    reflecting off the surface beneath them, while laser mice provide more precision and can work on a broader range of
    surfaces due to their advanced tracking technology.
    <br>
    Many mice come with additional features beyond the basic buttons and scroll wheel. For instance, some have extra
    buttons that can be programmed for specific functions, such as navigating back and forth in web browsers or
    executing complex commands in games. High-performance gaming mice, in particular, may offer adjustable DPI settings,
    allowing users to change the sensitivity of the cursor movement on-the-fly for more precise control.
