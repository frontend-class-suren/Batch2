  <p>Nature is defined as our environment. It is the interaction between the physical world around us and the life
    within it like the atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna and humans. Nature also includes
    non-living things such as water, mountains, landscape, plants, trees and many other things.</p>
