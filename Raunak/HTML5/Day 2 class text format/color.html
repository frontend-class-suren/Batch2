   <p>Ecommerce, or electronic commerce, is the process of buying and selling goods and services over the internet. It involves the exchange of products or services between businesses, consumers, or both. 

    Ecommerce business is facilitated through platforms such as websites, mobile apps, or online marketplaces. 
    
    Where ecommerce once described a simple process—a consumer purchase from an ecommerce site, for instance—the term has expanded as technologies have advanced. Today, ecommerce can refer to business-to-business commerce or internal business transactions. It can also apply to, for example: 
    
    The online stores of multichannel retailers with brick-and-mortar locations
    Sharing economy platforms facilitating the purchase of services like rideshares
    Social media sites like Facebook where consumers engage with so-called social commerce
    As the ecommerce industry has developed, it has also grown to encompass related technologies that facilitate the sales process, such as mobile payment platforms and secure data transfer technologies. </p>
