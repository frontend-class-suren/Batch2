            <h2>An Ocean of Sky</h2>
            <p class="par1">
                Before he sold his first novel, “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” for a hefty advance, Ocean Vuong was
                writing poetry. Which means he was broke. Which means he was making $8 an hour cleaning toilets at a
                Panera
                Bread.

                If you worked your way to regional manager, you could make 60 grand a year. “That would be considered
                fancy
                where I’m from,” Vuong says. <br>
                <br>

                It’s not clear what he means by where he’s from. There’s Ho Chi Minh City, where he was born and lived
                until
                he immigrated to the United States at age 2. Or Hartford, Conn., where he was raised by his mother and
                grandmother. Or he could simply mean people who didn’t grow up with much.

                At Brooklyn College, where he studied American literature after dropping out of business school, he
                bopped
                around cheap sublets and couches of newfound friends in the poetry community. One of his teachers was
                the
                poet and author Ben Lerner. <br>
                <br>
            <h2>Envisioning ‘a new gaze’</h2>
            <p class="par1">
                Vuong, 30, lives in a handsome single-story home in Northampton, Mass., where he teaches creative
                writing at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. When I visit, I am first greeted by his dog, a
                Shih Tzu-poodle mix named Tofu. We sit at a reclaimed wood dining table, where Vuong has laid out
                “Beloved,” “Gilead,” “Moby Dick” and other books that have inspired him. On the wall, there is an LP of
                Frank Ocean’s “Blonde.”

                Vuong likes the quiet, domestic rhythms of living in Northampton. Before, he was living on Long Island,
                commuting two-and-a-half hours each way to teach poetry at New York University. He lived among roommates
                with kids. It was a noisy home, so Vuong would write in his bedroom closet. (As a queer author, he says,
                “The irony is not lost on me.”) It was a refuge: a laptop, lamp and Vuong with his headphones on, likely
                listening to Frank Ocean.

                Throughout the many revisions, the conceit was always clear: the novel would be a letter addressed to
                Vuong’s mother, who is illiterate. It uses a narrative structure called kishōtenketsu, commonly seen in
                the work of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, a form that refuses to deploy conflict as a means of progressing
                the story.

                “It insists that a narrative structure can survive and thrive on proximity alone,” Vuong says.
                “Proximity builds tension.”
