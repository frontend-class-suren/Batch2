    <h3 style="color: black;"><i>What is E-commerce?</i></h3>

    <p><strong>Ecommerce, or electronic commerce</strong>, is the process of buying and selling goods and services over the internet. It
        involves the exchange of products or services between businesses, consumers, or both.

        Ecommerce business is facilitated through platforms such as websites, mobile apps, or online
        marketplaces.

        Where ecommerce once described a simple process—a consumer purchase from an ecommerce site, for instance—the
        term has expanded as technologies have advanced. Today, ecommerce can refer to business-to-business commerce or
        internal business transactions. It can also apply to, for example:

        The online stores of multichannel retailers with brick-and-mortar locations
        Sharing economy platforms facilitating the purchase of services like rideshares
        Social media sites like Facebook where consumers engage with so-called social commerce
        As the ecommerce industry has developed, it has also grown to encompass related technologies that facilitate the
        sales process, such as mobile payment platforms and secure data transfer technologies. <br>
        <br>
    <h3> <i> How does e-commerce work?</i></h3>
    The ecommerce process is different from a traditional brick-and-mortar store. There are different steps along the
    way that take the initial contact between you and your consumer through to the money hitting your bank account after
    the final transaction. <br>
    <br>

        alt="E-commerce_image"> <br>
    The ecommerce industry is huge. Data shows global ecommerce sales could reach more than $6.5 trillion by 2023,
    accounting for nearly a quarter of all retail sales worldwide. If you want to get in on the retail industry without
    investing in brick and mortar stores, commerce websites are the way to do it.

    Let’s take a closer look at all the pieces of the puzzle that goes into online stores. <br>

    <h3><i>AMAZON</i></h3>

    <strong>Amazon</strong> was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington.[6] The company
    originally started as an
    online marketplace for books but gradually expanded its offerings to include a wide range of product categories.
    This diversification led to it being referred to as "The Everything Store".[7]

    The company has multiple subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing, Zoox, a
    self-driving car division, Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider, and Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&D
    provider. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in
    August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its market share and presence as a physical retailer.[8]
    Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon
    Music, Twitch, Audible and Wondery[9] units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film
    and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, which was acquired in
    March 2022, and owns Brilliance Audio and Audible, which produce and distribute audiobooks, respectively. Amazon
    also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs. <br>
    <br>
    Amazon has a reputation as a disruptor of industries through technological innovation and aggressive reinvestment of
    profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023, it is the world's largest online retailer and
    marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch,
    and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's
    largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close
    to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States[18] and
    the second-largest company in the World and in the US by revenue as of 2024.[19] As of October 2023, Amazon is the
    12th-most visited website in the world and 82% of its traffic comes from the United States.[20][21] Amazon is also
    the global leader in research and development spending, with R&D expenditure of US$73 billion in 2022.[22]

    Amazon has been criticized on various grounds, including but not limited to customer data collection practices, a
    toxic work culture, censorship, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive practices. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>History</h3>

    <h3><i>1994–2009</i></h3>

    Jeff Bezos's home in Bellevue, Washington, where the company was founded in 1994
    Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> after he relocated from New York City to
    Bellevue, Washington,
    near Seattle, to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent
    from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the
    proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options,
    including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado.[23] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the
    converted garage of Bezos's house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994.[24] The Amazon
    website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and
    publishers.[23][25]

    Amazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by
    acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale
    of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items,
    software, games, and toys.[26][27]

    In 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to
    build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website
    popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward
    providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in
    2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the
    Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called "third-party sellers") to sell
    products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]

    <h3> <i>2010–present</i></h3>
    Amazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United
    States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts
    globally.[35]

    Amazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and
    Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to "run normal shifts"
    due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its
    policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace
    safety.[40]

    On February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The
    transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In
    January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an
    attempt to cut costs.[43]

    On November 8, 2023, a plan was adopted for Jeff Bezos to sell approximately 50 million shares of the company over
    the next year (the deadline for the entire sales plan is January 31, 2025). The first step was the sale of 12
    million shares for about $2 billion. <br>

    <h3><i>eBay</i></h3>
    <strong>eBay Inc.</strong> ( EE-bay, often stylized as ebay and/or Ebay) is an American multinational e-commerce
    company based
    in San Jose, California, that allows users to buy or view items via retail sales through online marketplaces
    and websites in 190 markets worldwide. Sales occur either via online auctions or "buy it now" instant sales, and the
    company charges commissions to sellers upon sales. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in September 1995. It has 132
    million yearly active buyers worldwide and handled $73 billion in transactions in 2023, 48% of which was in the
    United States. In 2023, the company had a take rate (revenue as a percentage of volume) of 13.81%.

    eBay is used by individuals, companies, as well as governments to purchase and sell almost any legal,
    non-controversial item. eBay's auctions use a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid) proxy bid system. Buyers and sellers may
    rate and review each other after each transaction, resulting in a reputation system. The eBay service is accessible
    via websites and mobile apps. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay
    API. Merchants can also earn commissions from affiliate marketing programs by eBay. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <h3><i>1990s</i></h3>
    eBay was founded as AuctionWeb in California on September 4, 1995, by French-born Iranian-American computer
    programmer <strong> Pierre Omidyar</strong> as a hobby to make some extra money. One of the first items sold on
    AuctionWeb was a
    broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the
    laser pointer was broken; the buyer explained: "I'm a collector of broken laser pointers.

    In February 1996, Omidyar's internet service provider informed him that he would need to upgrade to a business
    account due to the high web traffic of his website. The monthly price increase from $30 to $250 prompted Omidyar to
    start charging eBay users. The website made $1,000 in its first month, which was more than it cost to run, and
    $2,500 in its second month. Chris Agarpao was eBay's first employee; he processed mailed check payments.

    Jeffrey Skoll was hired as the first president of the company in early 1996.In November 1996, the company
    launched online auctions for airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise berths and other travel-related products in
    partnership with Electronic Travel Auctions. By that time, the company had hosted more than 200,000 auctions since
    its founding 14 months earlier.

    The company changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997, after Echo Bay Technology
    Group, Omidyar's consulting firm. The echobay.com domain name was already registered by Echo Bay Mines, a gold
    mining company, so Omidyar shortened it to eBay.com. In 1997, the company received $6.7 million in venture capital
    funding from Benchmark.

    The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar's fiancée trade Pez candy dispensers was
    fabricated in 1997 by public relations manager Mary Lou Song to give the media a human-interest story and to
    generate publicity with toy collectors.The most purchased and sold items on the website were Beanie Babies, the
    most difficult toys to find in retail stores, accounting for 10% of all listings in 1997. Ty, the manufacturer, had
    set up a website whereby people could trade used Beanie Babies. However, it was overwhelmed with unsortable
    listings. With a user-friendly interface, eBay became popular with collectors.

    In September 1998, during the dot-com bubble, eBay became a public company via an initial public offering led by CFO
    Gary F. Bengier. Upon the initial public offering, which was priced at $18 per share and closed for trading on
    its first day at $53 per share, both Omidyar and Skoll became billionaires. In the risk factors section of the
    annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998, Omidyar noted eBay's dependence on the
    continued strength of the Beanie Babies market. <br>
    <br>
    <h3><i>2000s</i></h3>

    In June 2000, eBay acquired Half.com for $312 million in stock.In 2000, eBay partnered with Escrow.com to
    handle escrow for purchases and sales of motor vehicles, later expanded to other transaction types. By year-end,
    it had 22.5 million registered users and 79.4 million auctions per quarter.

    In January 2001, eBay acquired a majority stake in Internet Auction Co. Ltd, operator of the largest internet
    auction website in South Korea. In February 2002, eBay acquired iBazar, a French online auction site founded in
    1998, for approximately $112 million in stock. eBay entered the Chinese market in 2002 and shut down its
    Chinese site in 2007 due to competition from local rival Taobao.

    In February 2002, eBay exited Japan due to competition from Yahoo! Japan and began operations in Taiwan with the
    acquisition of NeoCom Technology for $9.5 million. In June 2006, eBay turned over its operations in Taiwan
    to a joint venture partner.

    On May 28, 2003, in the case of eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., which had implications for the treatment of
    business method patents, a United States district court jury found eBay guilty of willful patent infringement and
    ordered the company to pay $35 million in damages after MercExchange accused eBay of infringing on three patents,
    one of which is used in eBay's "Buy It Now" feature. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
    for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). The CAFC affirmed the judgment of willful infringement, and reversed the lower court
    and granted a permanent injunction. eBay appealed the permanent injunction to the Supreme Court of the United
    States, which on May 15, 2006 found an injunction is not required nor automatic in this or any patent case where
    guilt has been established. The case was sent back to the Virginia district court for consideration of the
    injunction and a trial on another MercExchange patent.

    In August 2004, eBay acquired 25% of the classified advertising website Craigslist for $32 million. Former
    disgruntled Craigslist executive Phillip Knowlton was the seller.In December 2004, eBay acquired Rent.com for

    included simple wizard-driven website, e-commerce capabilities, site design tools and e-business management. Smaller
    merchants could also manage the entire process of posting and selling products on eBay using the ProStores
    interface. It also offered inventory management, supplier communication and integration with Quickbooks and
    Dreamweaver. eBay announced on July 1, 2014 that support for the platform would end February 1, 2015.In
    February 2006, Intuit launched a web-based version of ItsDeductible, a donation tracking service, using data from
    eBay to help users assign a market value to the items they donate. <br>

    September 2012, eBay introduced a new logo using a thinner variation of the Univers typeface. It replaced the
    thicker Univers logo.
    In November 2012, eBay was charged in the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, accused by the United States
    Department of Justice of entering into non-solicitation agreements with other technology companies involving highly
    skilled employees.The litigation was settled in May 2014, with eBay required to end anti-competitive
    practices.
    On September 30, 2014, eBay announced it would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a demand
    made nine months prior by activist hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn.The spinoff was completed on July 18,

    logistics and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the
    world in numerous business sectors. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <h3><i>Early years</i></h3>
    On 28 June 1999,<strong>Jack Ma</strong>, with 17 friends and students founded Alibaba.com, a China-based B2B
    marketplace site,
    in his Hangzhou apartment. In October 1999, Alibaba received a US$25 million investment from Swedish Wallenberg
    family's Investor AB,Goldman Sachs and SoftBank. In 1999, Wallenbergs Investor AB owned 6% of the shares.
    Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for Chinese
    enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global
    market as well as to address World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. In 2002, Alibaba.com became profitable three
    years after launch. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system, so from 2003 onward, Alibaba launched Taobao
    Marketplace, Alipay, Alimama.com, and Lynx.

    When eBay announced its expansion into China in 2003, Ma viewed the American company as a foreign competitor and
    rejected eBay's buyout of Alibaba's subsidiary Taobao. By applying existing technologies, gaining trust in the
    Chinese e-commerce market, and expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on
    additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing
    percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with
    eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would break even six years later. <br>
