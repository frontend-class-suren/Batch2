    <h3><i>A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There by Aldo Leopold</i></h3>

    <p>A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There is a 1949 non-fiction book by American ecologist, forester,
        and environmentalist <strong style="color:brown;">Aldo Leopold</strong>. Describing the land around the author's
        home in Sauk County,
        Wisconsin, the
        collection of essays advocate Leopold's idea of a <mark>"land ethic"</mark>, or a responsible relationship
        existing between
        people and the land they inhabit. Edited and published <span style="background-color: blue;color: white;"> by
            his son</span>, Luna, a year after Leopold's death, the book
        is considered a landmark in the American conservation movement. <br>
        <br>
        The book has had over two million copies printed and has been translated into at least fourteen languages.[1] It
        has informed and changed the environmental movement and stimulated a widespread interest in ecology as a
        science. <br>
        <br>A Sand County Almanac is a combination of <mark>natural history</mark>, scene painting with words, and
        philosophy. It is
        perhaps best known for the following quote, which defines Leopold's land ethic: "A thing is right when it tends
        to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."
        The original publication format was issued by Oxford University Press in 1949. It incorporated a number of
        previously published essays that Leopold had been contributing to popular hunting and conservation magazines,
        along with a set of longer, more philosophical essays. The final format was assembled by <strong
            style="color:brown;">Luna
            Leopold</strong> shortly
        after his father's death, but based closely on notes that presumably reflected <strong style="color:brown;">
            Aldo Leopold's
        </strong>intentions.
        Subsequent editions have changed both the format and the content of the essays included in the original. <br>
        <br>
        The book has also had great influence on environmental thinkers: <mark>"along with Walden and Rachel
            Carsonâ€™s</mark> Silent
        Spring, one of the main intellectual underpinnings of environmentalism in America".[7] The book has "attracted
        such overwhelming attention from environmental philosophers as a source of inspiration and ideas". <br>
