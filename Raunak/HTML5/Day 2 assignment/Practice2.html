             <h4><i>The Power of Positive Thinking – Book Review</i></h4>

   <p>Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, <strong>the father of positive thinking</strong>, and God bless his soul, wrote this simple guide to offer the mind more desirable food. I must admit, when I picked up this one, my mind was spinning many <mark>negative thoughts</mark>. I was going through the process of cleaning myself from everything wrong in my life, including addiction. By the end of the book, I was more than surprised by the effect it had on my mind. Moreover, I come back to reread this book whenever I start to think negative thoughts. Even a look on random page switches my mind on the positive side of the river called life.

    The <abbr title="Power of positive thinking"> POPT</abbr> by late Dr. Norman Vicen Peale, goes on a little bit over 300 pages, divided into 17 chapters. More than often <span style="background-color: rgb(240, 139, 38);color: rgb(2, 92, 218);">Dr. Pale</span> emphasizes the importance of religion as a medium of the transformation of the mind. He was a pastor in a Marble Collegiate Church of New York and a practitioner of Christianity and positive thinking for whole his life. However, the first chapter of the book is named “Believe in Yourself.” By this, he means that no matter what is your religion, even if you don’t have one, you must be able to believe in your self before you can start the process of change of mind.
    
    The benefits I felt after reading his book was <small>surprising</small> . And I am of the belief that everyone who goes through this book will see different, yet same benefits. Different because everyone’s life and problems are different. However, the same, because the end product will be a mind full of positive thoughts. <br>
    <br>

    The book is written in a <sub>simple language</sub> so that everyone can <sup>understand it</sup>. Dr. Peale tells many, many real-life stories. Majority of those stories are coming from his experience working with some of the most negative minds in his career. A businessman who lost everything and becomes stuck in thinking how he is doomed manages to recover and bounce right back after one meeting with the author of the book. A woman who became so negative in her marriage manages to save the relationship with her husband after applying a few simple advises from Dr. Peale. The book is filled with examples of many different negative situations, and every one of those ended up with the same result, a better and fulfilled life.
    
    What I liked the most about this book is the chapter <mark>“Inflow of New Thoughts Can Remake You.”</mark> It is simple as it sounds. Just stop, flush out the old, negative thought, and replace it with a new better on. Basically, try to concentrate your mind on everything positive in your life and your life will become positive. Not just that, you will start to attract more of the same as long as you keep feeding positive thoughts into your mind. <br>
    
    <br>

    “… you don’t need to be defeated by anything … you can have peace of mind, improved health, and a never-ceasing flow of energy … your life can be full of joy and satisfaction … Of this, I have no doubt at all …” Norman Vincent Peale <br>
    To all who wishes to push themselves on the positive side of the river, I recommend taking The Power of Positive Thinking in his or her hands. This book does wonders, and I am happy for all who are going to read it because your life will never be the same again.

    Thank you for your <strong>life Dr. Peale</strong>, and <mark>rest in peace…</mark> <br>
