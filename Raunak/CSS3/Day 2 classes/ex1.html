        <h3>ANIME</h3>
        <hr>
        <strong>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ)</strong> is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation
        originating from Japan.
        Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and
        Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also
        produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as
        anime. <br>
        <br>

        The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with
        the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet.
        In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
        games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.[2] <br>

        Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
        technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
        individualistic techniques.[3] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
        movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle
        shots.[3] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
        characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[4] <br><br>

        The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli,
        Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Madhouse, Inc., TMS
        Entertainment, Pierrot (company), Production I.G, Nippon Animation and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the
        medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming,
        and since the 2010s due to the rise of streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture,
        both within Japan and worldwide.[5][6] As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated
        television shows.[7]

            Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump Giga from April to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon
            volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in December 2018. <br><br>
    
            Jujutsu Kaisen is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has published the
            manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the Manga Plus online platform.
            Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. An anime

            second season aired from July to December 2023. A sequel covering the "Culling Game" arc has been announced.
